    >Webpage should only show the first 20ish exhibits in the API to reduce lag and such
    >Each exhibit should have a button to add it to their visit plan
3. User can add the exhibits they are interested in to a "plan to visit list"
    >HTML Webpage should have a second container with the exhibits that the user has added to their plan
